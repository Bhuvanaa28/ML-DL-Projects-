The neural network consists of 3 input neurons in the input layer, 12 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output neuron in the output layer.
The 3 inputs are the R, G, B values of the color. The output value to be predicted by the model is the preference score value of the color.
Firstly, training data is obtained from the user. The colors are randomly generated and the user preference for each color is obtained. 
The model is trained and is made to predict the preference value for randomly generated colors. Top 10 colors with the highest preference score is displayed.

Colors similar to the colors with highest preference score is predicted by the model.

Thus, recommendation of colors similar to the user preference (i.e., colors with the highest preference score by user input) is obtained.
